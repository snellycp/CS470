# CS470
# Final Reflection – Cloud Development

## Developer: Sandra Cardenas  
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Assignment:** Final Reflection and Conference Presentation  

## Project Overview

This repository contains my final reflection for CS 470: Full Stack Development in the Cloud. The project showcases my experience migrating a full stack MEAN application to a cloud-native, serverless architecture using AWS services like Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.

The reflection includes an overview of the technical skills I’ve developed, the roles I’m prepared to take on as a developer, and how I plan to support future application growth using cloud principles like scalability, elasticity, and cost-efficiency.
